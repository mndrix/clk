# needed before releasing to CPAN
* clk pull
* clk push

# nice to have
* clk in /something-rare (clk in by searching for a template)
* clk gc (remove deletions, compress entries, etc)
* go through an optimization phase to make sure everything is fast
    * run and optimize clk on askos. it makes everything seem slow :-)
* reduce the number of module dependencies
* implement more instant spec units (we only support m=minutes now)

# pie in the sky
* implement a general language for specifying time periods.  A time period
  can be specified as an amount of time to go backward from now followed by
  a command for choosing the enclosing duration.  For instance 'yesterday'
  means 'go back one day and choose the enclosing day'.  This could be
  denoted in terms of timespecs by appending the duration with something
  like '1d@d' meaning '1d = 1 day ago' and '@d = the enclosing day'
* allow for subsecond time resolution
