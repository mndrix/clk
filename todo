* clk fsck to verify data integrity.  this should traverse the timelines
  to make sure that all reference entries exist.  it should also calculate
  the SHA-256 value of the content of each entry and make sure that it matches
  the entry ID

* the timeline filenames should indicate a version number so that a new index
  format can be implemented easily

* clk rpt
* clk edit
* clk in /something-rare (clk in by searching for a template)


# at some point we might want to do these too
* implement a general language for specifying time periods.  A time period
  can be specified as an amount of time to go backward from now followed by
  a command for choosing the enclosing duration.  For instance 'yesterday'
  means 'go back one day and choose the enclosing day'.  This could be
  denoted in terms of timespecs by appending the duration with something
  like '1d@d' meaning '1d = 1 day ago' and '@d = the enclosing day'
* the timeline should use TAI64N to specify the time (to provide room for
  growth should sub-second resolution ever be needed)
