* implement 'this year' and 'last year' periods
* rename 'timespec' to 'instant' and 'periodspec' to 'period' in the code

* implement entry-search --period in terms of --between
* each entry should record an 'identity' field for the person recording it
  (this allows one person to pull entries from multiple people and run
  handy reports on the result.  this probably means that each identity
  needs his own set of timelines)

* the timeline filenames should indicate a version number so that a new index
  format can be implemented easily

* clk rpt
* clk edit
* clk in /something-rare (clk in by searching for a template)


# at some point we might want to do these too
* implement a general language for specifying time periods.  A time period
  can be specified as an amount of time to go backward from now followed by
  a command for choosing the enclosing duration.  For instance 'yesterday'
  means 'go back one day and choose the enclosing day'.  This could be
  denoted in terms of timespecs by appending the duration with something
  like '1d@d' meaning '1d = 1 day ago' and '@d = the enclosing day'
* the timeline should use TAI64N to specify the time (to provide room for
  growth should sub-second resolution ever be needed)
